# üçπ MOHITO: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using Hypergraphs for Task-Open Systems

This is the implementation for `MOHITO` our multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) solution for task-open Markov games (TaO-MG). This work is published in the paper: [MOHITO: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using Hypergraphs for Task-Open Systems]() at UAI 2025. 

**Wildfire** and **Rideshare**, our two domains, have different requirements. **Wildfire** here is a fork of [Free-Range-Zoo]() a api for open MARL environments. This fork allows for multiple wildfires to exist in the same cell.  **Rideshare** is a precursor to the free-range-zoo rideshare and operates slightly differently.

Below are the instructions to install and run Rideshare and Wildfire. They have different requirements be careful to avoid dependency conflicts.
